Input: nums = [1,2]
Output: 1
Explanation:
Choose nums[0...1]: (1 AND 2) = 0, so the array becomes [0, 0] and all elements are equal in 1 operation.
#code:
class Solution {
public:
    int minOperations(vector<int>& nums) {
        set<int>st;
        //if there all same element ans is -> 0 
        //if there is diff element means set size is not 1 , so we take 1 ops and make all same by AND oprator
        for(auto i:nums){
            st.insert(i);
        }
        if(st.size()==1) return 0; // means already same
        else return 1; // means we need to do one step take subarr 0--n-1
    }
};
