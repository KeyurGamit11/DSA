Input: n = 6, m = 5, k = 5
Output: 5
Explanation:
Cut the log with length 6 into logs with length 1 and 5, at a cost equal to 1 * 5 == 5. Now the three logs of length 1, 5, and 5 can fit in one truck each.
#code:
class Solution {
public:
    long long minCuttingCost(int n, int m, int k) {
        long long ans=0;
        if(n<=k && m<=k){
            return 0;
        }
        if(n>k){
            ans += (long long)k*(n-k);
        }
        else if(m > k){
            ans += (long long)k*(m-k);
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
