Explanation: These are the possible outcomes:
1. You remove 1 stone. Your friend removes 3 stones, including the last stone. Your friend wins.
2. You remove 2 stones. Your friend removes 2 stones, including the last stone. Your friend wins.
3. You remove 3 stones. Your friend removes the last stone. Your friend wins.
In all outcomes, your friend wins.
Step:
Try a few test cases to observe a pattern:
When n=1: True
When n=2: True
When n=3: True
When n=4: False no matter what you choose
When n=5: True
When n=8: False no matter what you choose
#code:
class Solution {
public:
    bool canWinNim(int n) {
        if(n <= 3) return true;
        if(n%4 == 0){
            return false;
        }
        else{
            return true;
        }
    }
};
