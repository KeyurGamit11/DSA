Input: nums = [10,10,3,7,6]
Output: 4
Explanation:
The 4 partitions are:
[10], [10, 3, 7, 6] with a sum difference of 10 - 26 = -16, which is even.
[10, 10], [3, 7, 6] with a sum difference of 20 - 16 = 4, which is even.
[10, 10, 3], [7, 6] with a sum difference of 23 - 13 = 10, which is even.
[10, 10, 3, 7], [6] with a sum difference of 30 - 6 = 24, which is even.
#code:
class Solution {
public:
    int countPartitions(vector<int>& nums) {
        int leftsum=0,n=nums.size(),cnt=0;
        int rightsum = accumulate(nums.begin(),nums.end(),0);
        for(int i=0; i<n-1; i++){
            leftsum += nums[i];
            rightsum -= nums[i];
            if(abs(rightsum - leftsum ) %2==0){
                cnt++;
            }
        }
        return cnt;
    }
};
