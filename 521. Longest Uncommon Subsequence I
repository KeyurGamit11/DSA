Input: a = "aba", b = "cdc"
Output: 3
Explanation: One longest uncommon subsequence is "aba" because "aba" is a subsequence of "aba" but not "cdc".
Note that "cdc" is also a longest uncommon subsequence.
#code:
class Solution {
public:
    int findLUSlength(string a, string b) {
        
        if(a == b){
            return -1; //means both same so ans is -1 
        }
        return max(a.size(),b.size()); //means both are not same so ans is maximum size between both
        
    }
};
