Input: original = [1,2,3,4], m = 2, n = 2
Output: [[1,2],[3,4]]
Explanation: The constructed 2D array should contain 2 rows and 2 columns.
The first group of n=2 elements in original, [1,2], becomes the first row in the constructed 2D array.
The second group of n=2 elements in original, [3,4], becomes the second row in the constructed 2D array.
#code:
class Solution {
public:
    vector<vector<int>> construct2DArray(vector<int>& original, int m, int n) {

        if(original.size() != m*n){
            return {};
        }
        vector<vector<int>>mat(m, vector<int>(n));
        for(int i=0; i<m; i++){
            for(int j=0; j<n; j++){
                mat[i][j] = original[i*n+j];
            }
        }
        return mat;
    }
};
