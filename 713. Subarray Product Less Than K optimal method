Input: nums = [10,5,2,6], k = 100
Output: 8
Explanation: The 8 subarrays that have product less than 100 are:
[10], [5], [2], [6], [10, 5], [5, 2], [2, 6], [5, 2, 6]
Note that [10, 5, 2] is not included as the product of 100 is not strictly less than k.
#code:
class Solution {
#define ll long long
public:
    int numSubarrayProductLessThanK(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
        if(k<1)return 0;
        ll cnt=0;
        int n=nums.size();
        ll r=0,l=0,pro=1;
        while(r < n){
            pro *= nums[r];
            // Shrink the window until the product is less than k
            while(pro >= k && l <= r){ // also we need to ensure l not cross r
                pro /= nums[l];
                l++;
            }
            cnt += (r-l+1); // total length of arr is total num of subarray
            r++;

        }
        return cnt;
    }
};
