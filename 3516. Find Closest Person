Input: x = 2, y = 7, z = 4
Output: 1
Explanation:
Person 1 is at position 2 and can reach Person 3 (at position 4) in 2 steps.
Person 2 is at position 7 and can reach Person 3 in 3 steps.
Since Person 1 reaches Person 3 first, the output is 1.
#code:
class Solution {
public:
    int findClosest(int x, int y, int z) {
        int one = abs(z-x);
        int two = abs(z-y);
        if(one < two){
            return 1;
        }else if(two < one){
            return 2;
        }else{
            return 0;
        }
    }
};
