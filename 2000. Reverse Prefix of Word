Example 1:
Input: word = "abcdefd", ch = "d"
Output: "dcbaefd"
Explanation: The first occurrence of "d" is at index 3. 
Reverse the part of word from 0 to 3 (inclusive), the resulting string is "dcbaefd".
#step:
use two pointer for reversing string
find first occurance index
take first index s as 0
and e endex is we found first 
then apply reverse operation

#code :
class Solution {
public:
    string reversePrefix(string word, char ch) {
     // finding first occurance of ch
        int index=0;
        for(int i=0; i<word.size(); i++){
            if(ch == word[i]){
                index = i;
                break;
            }
        }
    // use two pointer for reversing 
        int s =0;
        int e = index;
        while(s < e){
            swap(word[s] , word[e]);
                s++;
                e--;
        }
        return word;
    }
};
