If it's empty sting, return 0;
If it's palindrome, return 1;
Otherwise, we need at least 2 operation.
Input: s = "ababa"
Output: 1
Explanation: s is already a palindrome, so its entirety can be removed in a single step.
#code:
class Solution {
public:
    int removePalindromeSub(string s) {
        int cnt=0;
        int i=0,j=s.size()-1;
        while(i<j){
            if(s[i]!=s[j]){
                return 2; //if not ot always take two moves
            }
            i++;
            j--;
        }
        return 1;//means it is palindrome so e can remove it by 1 moves
    }
};
