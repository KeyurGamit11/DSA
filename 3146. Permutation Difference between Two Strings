Example 1:
Input: s = "abc", t = "bac"
Output: 2
Explanation:
For s = "abc" and t = "bac", the permutation difference of s and t is equal to the sum of:
The absolute difference between the index of the occurrence of "a" in s and the index of the occurrence of "a" in t.
The absolute difference between the index of the occurrence of "b" in s and the index of the occurrence of "b" in t.
The absolute difference between the index of the occurrence of "c" in s and the index of the occurrence of "c" in t.
That is, the permutation difference between s and t is equal to |0 - 1| + |2 - 2| + |1 - 0| = 2.
code:
class Solution {
public:
    int findPermutationDifference(string s, string t) {
        int sum =0;
        for(int i=0; i<s.size(); i++){
            for(int j=0; j<t.size(); j++){
                if(s[i] == t[j]){
                    sum += abs(i-j);
                }
            }
        }
        return sum;
     
    }
};
