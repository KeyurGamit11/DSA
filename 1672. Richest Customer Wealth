Input: accounts = [[1,2,3],[3,2,1]]
Output: 6
Explanation:
1st customer has wealth = 1 + 2 + 3 = 6
2nd customer has wealth = 3 + 2 + 1 = 6
Both customers are considered the richest with a wealth of 6 each, so return 6.
#step:
we jsut count one by one array sum 
i traverse into array and j traverse into thst perticular i array
#code:
class Solution {
public:
    int maximumWealth(vector<vector<int>>& accounts) {
        int n = accounts.size();
        int maxi=0;
        int sum = 0;
        for(int i=0; i<n; i++){
            int sum =0;
            for(int j=0; j<accounts[i].size(); j++){
                sum += accounts[i][j]; 
                maxi = max(maxi , sum);
            }
        }
        return maxi;
    }
};
