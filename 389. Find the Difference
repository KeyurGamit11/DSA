Input: s = "abcd", t = "abcde"
Output: "e"
Explanation: 'e' is the letter that was added.
#step:
we are using xor(^) function same same char will be xor with eachother and become zero and differnt charcter 
#code:
class Solution {
public:
    char findTheDifference(string s, string t) {
      char result =0;
      for(char c:s){
        result ^= c;
      }
      for(char c:t){
        result ^= c;
      }
      return result;
    }
};
