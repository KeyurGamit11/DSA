Input: s = "l|*e*et|c**o|*de|"
Output: 2
Explanation: The considered characters are underlined: "l|*e*et|c**o|*de|".
The characters between the first and second '|' are excluded from the answer.
Also, the characters between the third and fourth '|' are excluded from the answer.
There are 2 asterisks considered. Therefore, we return 2.
#code:
class Solution {
public:
    int countAsterisks(string s) {
        int cnt=0;
        int starcnt=0;

        for(int i=0; i<s.size(); i++){
            if(s[i]=='|'){
                cnt++;
            }
            if(cnt%2==0 && s[i]=='*'){
                starcnt++;
            }
           
        }
        //cout<<cnt<<endl;
        return starcnt;
    }
};
