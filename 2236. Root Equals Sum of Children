Input: root = [10,4,6]
Output: true
Explanation: The values of the root, its left child, and its right child are 10, 4, and 6, respectively.
10 is equal to 4 + 6, so we return true.
#code:
class Solution {
public:
    bool checkTree(TreeNode* root) {
        return root->val == root->left->val+root->right->val;
    }
};
