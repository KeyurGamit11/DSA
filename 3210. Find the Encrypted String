Input: s = "dart", k = 3
Output: "tdar"
Explanation:
For i = 0, the 3rd character after 'd' is 't'.
For i = 1, the 3rd character after 'a' is 'd'.
For i = 2, the 3rd character after 'r' is 'a'.
For i = 3, the 3rd character after 't' is 'r'.
#code:
class Solution {
public:
    string getEncryptedString(string s, int k) {
       
        int n = s.size();
        k = k % n;
        if(k==0){
            return s;
        }
        string ans;
        for(int i=0; i<n; i++){
           int newpos = (i+k)%n;
           ans += s[newpos];
        }
        return ans;;
    }
};
