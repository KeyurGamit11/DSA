Input: nums = [2,1,3,2,1,3]
Output: 5
Explanation:
In the first step, select elements at indices 2, 4, and 5, which have a median 3. After removing these elements, nums becomes [2, 1, 2].
In the second step, select elements at indices 0, 1, and 2, which have a median 2. After removing these elements, nums becomes empty.
Hence, the sum of the medians is 3 + 2 = 5.
#code:
class Solution {
public:
    long long maximumMedianSum(vector<int>& nums) {
        long long ans=0;
        sort(nums.begin(),nums.end());
        //sort arr , we have take 3 el , take maxi,sec_mexi and mini in arr , 
        //so we always take se_mexi in ans that is optimal
        int n = nums.size(); 
        for(int i=n-2; i>=n/3; i-=2){
            ans += nums[i];
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
