Input: timeSeries = [1,4], duration = 2
Output: 4
Explanation: Teemo's attacks on Ashe go as follows:
- At second 1, Teemo attacks, and Ashe is poisoned for seconds 1 and 2.
- At second 4, Teemo attacks, and Ashe is poisoned for seconds 4 and 5.
Ashe is poisoned for seconds 1, 2, 4, and 5, which is 4 seconds in total.
#code:
class Solution {
public:
    int findPoisonedDuration(vector<int>& timeSeries, int duration) {
        int sec=0;
        for(int i=0; i<timeSeries.size()-1; i++){
           sec += min(duration , (timeSeries[i+1]-timeSeries[i]));
        }
        sec += duration;
        return sec;
    }
};
