Input: s = "yyyzz", k = 1
Output: 2
Explanation:
s has two distinct characters ('y' and 'z') with frequencies of 3 and 2, respectively.
Since we can have at most k = 1 distinct character, remove all occurrences of any one character from the string.
Removing all 'z' results in at most k distinct characters. Thus, the answer is 2.
#code:
class Solution {
public:
    int minDeletion(string s, int k) {
        vector<int> freq(26, 0);
        for (auto i : s) {
            freq[(i - 'a')]++;
        }
        sort(freq.begin(),freq.end());
        int ans=0;
        //remove smallest freq
        for(int i=0; i<freq.size()-k; i++){
            ans+=freq[i];
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
