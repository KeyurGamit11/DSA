Input: height = [1,2,3,4,5], threshold = 2
Output: [3,4]
Explanation:
Mountain 3 is stable because height[2] == 3 is greater than threshold == 2.
Mountain 4 is stable because height[3] == 4 is greater than threshold == 2
#code:
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> stableMountains(vector<int>& height, int threshold) {
        vector<int>ans;
        int n=height.size();
        for(int i=0; i<n-1; i++){
            if(height[i] > threshold){
                ans.push_back(i+1);
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
