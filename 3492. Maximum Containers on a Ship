Input: n = 2, w = 3, maxWeight = 15
Output: 4
Explanation:
The deck has 4 cells, and each container weighs 3. The total weight of loading all containers is 12, which does not exceed maxWeight.
#code:
class Solution {
public:
    int maxContainers(int n, int w, int maxWeight) {
        int deck = n*n;
        int cnt=0,total_w=0;
        while(deck-- && total_w < maxWeight){
            if(total_w + w > maxWeight) break;
            total_w += w;
            cnt++;
        }
        return cnt;
    }
};
