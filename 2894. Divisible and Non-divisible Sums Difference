Input: n = 10, m = 3
Output: 19
Explanation: In the given example:
- Integers in the range [1, 10] that are not divisible by 3 are [1,2,4,5,7,8,10], num1 is the sum of those integers = 37.
- Integers in the range [1, 10] that are divisible by 3 are [3,6,9], num2 is the sum of those integers = 18.
We return 37 - 18 = 19 as the answer.
#code:
class Solution {
public:
    int differenceOfSums(int n, int m) {
        int Divisible=0;
        int Non_divisible=0;
        for(int i=1; i<=n; i++){
            if(i%m != 0){
                Non_divisible += i;
            }
            else{
                Divisible += i;
            }
        }
       // cout<<Non_divisible <<endl;
        //cout<<Divisible <<endl;
        return Non_divisible - Divisible;
    }
};
