Input: arr = ["d","b","c","b","c","a"], k = 2
Output: "a"
Explanation:
The only distinct strings in arr are "d" and "a".
"d" appears 1st, so it is the 1st distinct string.
"a" appears 2nd, so it is the 2nd distinct string.
Since k == 2, "a" is returned. 
#code:
class Solution {
public:
    string kthDistinct(vector<string>& arr, int k) {
        unordered_map<string,int>mp;

        for(auto i:arr){
            mp[i]++; // count all string count
        }
        int distinctcnt=0;
        for(auto i:arr){
            if(mp[i] == 1){ // if count is 1 increment distinct cnt 
                distinctcnt++;
                if(distinctcnt == k){ //if distinct is equal to k return it  
                    return i;
                }
            }
        }
        return "";
    }
};
