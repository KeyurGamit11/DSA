Input: s = "cccaaa"
Output: "aaaccc"
Explanation: Both 'c' and 'a' appear three times, so both "cccaaa" and "aaaccc" are valid answers.
Note that "cacaca" is incorrect, as the same characters must be together.
#code:

        }
        priority_queue<pair<int,char>>pq; //take pq of pair char and theire cnt
        for(auto &[ch,freq]:mp){
            pq.push({freq,ch}); //push based on theire freq
        }
        while(!pq.empty()){
            int freq = pq.top().first; //we need to take element time that occur,freq of element
            while(freq != 0){
                ans.push_back(pq.top().second); //push into ans based on freq of element
