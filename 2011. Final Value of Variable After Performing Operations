Example 1:
Input: operations = ["--X","X++","X++"]
Output: 1
Explanation: The operations are performed as follows:
Initially, X = 0.
--X: X is decremented by 1, X =  0 - 1 = -1.
X++: X is incremented by 1, X = -1 + 1 =  0.
X++: X is incremented by 1, X =  0 + 1 =  1.
#code:
class Solution {
public:
    int finalValueAfterOperations(vector<string>& operations) {
       int x=0;
       for(int i=0; i<operations.size(); i++){
          if(operations[i] == "--X" || operations[i] == "X--"){
            x--;
          }
          else if(operations[i] == "X++" || operations[i] == "++X"){
            x++;
          }
       }
       return x; 
    }
};
