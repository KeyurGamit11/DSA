Input: nums = [4,1,4,0,3,5]
Output: 2
Explanation:
1. Remove 0 and 5, and the average is (0 + 5) / 2 = 2.5. Now, nums = [4,1,4,3].
2. Remove 1 and 4. The average is (1 + 4) / 2 = 2.5, and nums = [4,3].
3. Remove 3 and 4, and the average is (3 + 4) / 2 = 3.5.
Since there are 2 distinct numbers among 2.5, 2.5, and 3.5, we return 2.
#code:
class Solution {
public:
    int distinctAverages(vector<int>& nums) {
        set<double>st;
        sort(nums.begin(),nums.end());
        int i=0,j=nums.size()-1;
        while(i<j){
            double avg = (nums[i]+nums[j])/2.0; //we can only store sum also
            st.insert(avg);
            i++;
            j--;
        }
        return st.size();
    }
};
