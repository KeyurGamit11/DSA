Input: grid = [[2,4],[6,8]], x = 2
Output: 4
Explanation: We can make every element equal to 4 by doing the following: 
- Add x to 2 once.
- Subtract x from 6 once.
- Subtract x from 8 twice.
A total of 4 operations were used.
#code:
class Solution {
public:
    int minOperations(vector<vector<int>>& grid, int x) {

        int n = grid.size();
        int m = grid[0].size();
        vector<int> arr;
        for (auto i : grid) {
            for (auto j : i) {
                arr.push_back(j);
            }
        }
        sort(arr.begin(), arr.end());
        int mid = arr[arr.size() / 2];
        int ans = 0;
        int rem = arr[0] % x; //every el reminder with x should be same
        for (int i = 1; i < arr.size(); i++) {
            if (arr[i] % x != rem) {
                return -1;
            }
        }
        for (int i = 0; i < arr.size(); i++) {
            ans += abs(mid - arr[i]) / x;  //ops we need to make equal
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
