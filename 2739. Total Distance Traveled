Input: mainTank = 5, additionalTank = 10
Output: 60
Explanation: 
After spending 5 litre of fuel, fuel remaining is (5 - 5 + 1) = 1 litre and distance traveled is 50km.
After spending another 1 litre of fuel, no fuel gets injected in the main tank and the main tank becomes empty.
Total distance traveled is 60km.
#code:
class Solution {
public:
    int distanceTraveled(int mainTank, int additionalTank) {
        int ans = 0;
        while (mainTank >= 1) {

            ans++;
            mainTank--;
            if (ans % 5 == 0 && additionalTank > 0) {

                additionalTank--;
                mainTank++;
            }
        }
        return (ans) * 10;
    }
};
