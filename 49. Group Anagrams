Input: strs = ["eat","tea","tan","ate","nat","bat"]
Output: [["bat"],["nat","tan"],["ate","eat","tea"]]
Explanation:
There is no string in strs that can be rearranged to form "bat".
The strings "nat" and "tan" are anagrams as they can be rearranged to form each other.
The strings "ate", "eat", and "tea" are anagrams as they can be rearranged to form each other
#code:
class Solution {
    bool check(string s1 , string s2){
        sort(s1.begin(), s1.end());
        sort(s2.begin(),s2.end());
        return s1 == s2;
    }
public:
    vector<vector<string>> groupAnagrams(vector<string>& strs) {
        vector<vector<string>>ans;
        unordered_map<string,vector<string>>mp;

        for(auto s:strs){
            string sort_s = s;
            sort(sort_s.begin() , sort_s.end());
            mp[sort_s].push_back(s); //store orignal s and sort val like aet -> eat eg.
        }
        for(auto [key , val] : mp){
            ans.push_back(val);
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
