Input: fruits = [4,2,5], baskets = [3,5,4]
Output: 1
Explanation:
fruits[0] = 4 is placed in baskets[1] = 5.
fruits[1] = 2 is placed in baskets[0] = 3.
fruits[2] = 5 cannot be placed in baskets[2] = 4.
Since one fruit type remains unplaced, we return 1.
#code:
class Solution {
public:
    int numOfUnplacedFruits(vector<int>& fruits, vector<int>& baskets) {
        int n = baskets.size();
        vector<int>arr(n,0);
        int cnt=0;
        for(int i=0; i<n; i++){
            for(int j=0; j<n; j++){
                if(fruits[i] <= baskets[j] && arr[j] == 0){
                    cnt++;
                    arr[j] = 1;
                    break;
                }
            }
        }
        return n - cnt;
    }
};
