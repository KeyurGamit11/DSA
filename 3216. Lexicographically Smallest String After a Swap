Input: s = "45320"
Output: "43520"
Explanation:
s[1] == '5' and s[2] == '3' both have the same parity, and swapping them results in the lexicographically smallest string.
#code:
class Solution {
public:
    string getSmallestString(string s) {
        string ans=s;
        for(int i=0; i<s.size()-1; i++){
            if((s[i]-'0') %2 == (s[i+1]-'0')%2){ //means both adj have same parity also -'0' coverting into asc
                string copy = s;
                swap(copy[i] , copy[i+1]);  // swap in copy
                ans = min(ans,copy);
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
