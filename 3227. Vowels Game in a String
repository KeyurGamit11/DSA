Input: s = "leetcoder"
Output: true
Explanation:
Alice can win the game as follows:
Alice plays first, she can delete the underlined substring in s = "leetcoder" which contains 3 vowels. The resulting string is s = "der".
Bob plays second, he can delete the underlined substring in s = "der" which contains 0 vowels. The resulting string is s = "er".
Alice plays third, she can delete the whole string s = "er" which contains 1 vowel.
Bob plays fourth, since the string is empty, there is no valid play for Bob. So Alice wins the game.
#code:
class Solution {
public:
    bool doesAliceWin(string s) {
        //step is cnt vowels in s if there is vowel preset means alice means no matter how many vowels 
        //if there is no vowels in s that only way bob can win
        unordered_set<char> vowels = {'a','e','i','o','u'};
        int cntofvowels =0;
        for(auto c:s){
            if (vowels.find(c) != vowels.end()){
                cntofvowels++;
            }
        }
        if(cntofvowels >= 1){
            return true;
        }
        return false;
    }
};
