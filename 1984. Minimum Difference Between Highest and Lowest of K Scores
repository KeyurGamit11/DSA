Input: nums = [9,4,1,7], k = 2
Output: 2
Explanation: There are six ways to pick score(s) of two students:
- [9,4,1,7]. The difference between the highest and lowest score is 9 - 4 = 5.
- [9,4,1,7]. The difference between the highest and lowest score is 9 - 1 = 8.
- [9,4,1,7]. The difference between the highest and lowest score is 9 - 7 = 2.
- [9,4,1,7]. The difference between the highest and lowest score is 4 - 1 = 3.
- [9,4,1,7]. The difference between the highest and lowest score is 7 - 4 = 3.
- [9,4,1,7]. The difference between the highest and lowest score is 7 - 1 = 6.
The minimum possible difference is 2.
#code:
class Solution {
public:
    int minimumDifference(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
        int n=nums.size();
        int ans=INT_MAX;
        if(k==1)return 0;
        sort(nums.begin(),nums.end());
        for(int i=0; i<=n-k; i++){
            ans = min(nums[i+k-1]-nums[i] , ans);
        }
        
        return ans;

    }
};
