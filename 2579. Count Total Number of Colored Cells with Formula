Input: n = 2
Output: 5
Explanation: After 2 minutes, there are 4 colored cells on the boundary and 1 in the center, so we return 5. 
The formula for the number of colored cells at step n follows a quadratic pattern:

                    ans=1+2(nâˆ’1)n
#code:
class Solution {
public:
    long long coloredCells(int n) {
        
        return 1LL + 2LL *(n-1)*n; //formula
    }
};
