Input: s = "101"
Output: 1
Explanation: We can group all the black balls to the right in the following way:
- Swap s[0] and s[1], s = "011".
Initially, 1s are not grouped together, requiring at least 1 step to group them to the right.
#so in here we cnt of blackball if we fund any white all we just make black cnt into swap and continue
we can also do it for white black iterate through right to left
#code:
class Solution {
public:
    long long minimumSteps(string s) {
        long long  Blackcnt=0;
        long long swap=0;
        for(int i=0; i<s.size(); i++){
            if(s[i]=='1'){
                Blackcnt++; //cnt f blackball
            }
            else{
                swap += Blackcnt; //means 0 found so we swap all 1 and continue
            }
        }
        return swap;
    }
};
