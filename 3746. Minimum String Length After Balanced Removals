Input: s = "aabbab"
Output: 0
Explanation:
The substring "aabbab" has three 'a' and three 'b'. Since their counts are equal, we can remove the entire string directly. The minimum length is 0.
#code:
class Solution {
public:
    int minLengthAfterRemovals(string s) {
        int cnt1=0,cnt2=0;
        for(auto i:s){
            if(i=='a')cnt1++;
            else cnt2++;
        }
        return abs(cnt2-cnt1);
    }
};
