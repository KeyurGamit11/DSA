Input: num = 5
Output: 2
Explanation: The binary representation of 5 is 101 (no leading zero bits), and its complement is 010. So you need to output 2.
#code:
class Solution {
public:
    int findComplement(int num) {
        
        for(long long i=1; i<=num; i*=2){
             num^=i;
        }
        return num;
    }
};
