Input: nums = [5,3,6,1,12], original = 3
Output: 24
Explanation: 
- 3 is found in nums. 3 is multiplied by 2 to obtain 6.
- 6 is found in nums. 6 is multiplied by 2 to obtain 12.
- 12 is found in nums. 12 is multiplied by 2 to obtain 24.
- 24 is not found in nums. Thus, 24 is returned.
#code:
class Solution {
public:
    int findFinalValue(vector<int>& nums, int original) {
        unordered_set<int>st; // we can also use sort fun st(nums.begin(), nums.end());
        for(auto num:nums){
            st.insert(num); // insert all element in set
        }
        while(st.find(original) != st.end()){
            original *= 2;
        }
        return original;
    }
};
