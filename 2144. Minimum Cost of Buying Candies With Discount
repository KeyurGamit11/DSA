Input: cost = [1,2,3]
Output: 5
Explanation: We buy the candies with costs 2 and 3, and take the candy with cost 1 for free.
The total cost of buying all candies is 2 + 3 = 5. This is the only way we can buy the candies.
Note that we cannot buy candies with costs 1 and 3, and then take the candy with cost 2 for free.
The cost of the free candy has to be less than or equal to the minimum cost of the purchased candies.
#code:
class Solution {
public:
    int minimumCost(vector<int>& cost) {
        sort(cost.rbegin(), cost.rend());
        
        int ans = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < cost.size(); i++) {
            if (i % 3 != 2) { //skip third item
                ans += cost[i];
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
