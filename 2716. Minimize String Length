Input: s = "aaabc"
Output: 3
Explanation:
Operation 2: we choose i = 1 so c is 'a', then we remove s[2] as it is closest 'a' character to the right of s[1].
s becomes "aabc" after this.
Operation 1: we choose i = 1 so c is 'a', then we remove s[0] as it is closest 'a' character to the left of s[1].
s becomes "abc" after this.
#just use set , it gives only single char
#code:
class Solution {
public:
    int minimizedStringLength(string s) {
        set<char>st;
        for(auto i:s){
            st.insert(i);
        }
        return st.size();
    }
};
