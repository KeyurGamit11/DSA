Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
Note that buying on day 2 and selling on day 1 is not allowed because you must buy before you sell.
#code:
class Solution {
public:
    int maxProfit(vector<int>& prices) {
        int bestbuy = prices[0];
        int maxprofit = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i < prices.size(); ++i) {
            if (prices[i] > bestbuy) {
                maxprofit = max(maxprofit, prices[i] - bestbuy);
            }
            bestbuy = min(bestbuy, prices[i]);
        }
        return maxprofit;
    }
};
