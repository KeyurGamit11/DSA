Input: s = "coaching", t = "coding"
Output: 4
Explanation: Append the characters "ding" to the end of s so that s = "coachingding".
Now, t is a subsequence of s ("coachingding").
It can be shown that appending any 3 characters to the end of s will never make t a subsequence.
#code:
class Solution {
public:
    int appendCharacters(string s, string t) {
        int i=0;
        int j=0;
        
        while(i < s.size() && j < t.size()){
             if(s[i] == t[j]){
                j++;
             }
             i++;
        }
        return t.size()-j;
    }
};
