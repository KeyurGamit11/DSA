Input: blocks = "WBBWWBBWBW", k = 7
Output: 3
Explanation:
One way to achieve 7 consecutive black blocks is to recolor the 0th, 3rd, and 4th blocks
so that blocks = "BBBBBBBWBW". 
It can be shown that there is no way to achieve 7 consecutive black blocks in less than 3 operations.
Therefore, we return 3.
#code:
class Solution {
public:
    int minimumRecolors(string blocks, int k) {
        int ans=INT_MAX,r=0,l=0;
        int n = blocks.size();
        int black=0,white=0;
        while(r < n){
            if(blocks[r]=='W') white++;
            if(blocks[r] =='B') black++;
            while(r-l+1 > k){
                if(blocks[l]=='W')white--;
                if(blocks[l]=='B')black--;
                l++;
            }
            if(r-l+1==k){ //we need ops equal to white in k size subarray
                ans = min(ans,white);
            }
            
            r++;
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
