Input: num = 526
Output: true
Explanation: Reverse num to get 625, then reverse 625 to get 526, which equals num.
Input: num = 1800
Output: false
Explanation: Reverse num to get 81, then reverse 81 to get 18, which does not equal num. 
#from both example we can understand this if there is leading zero means after reverse num change if not means not change
#code:
class Solution {
public:
    bool isSameAfterReversals(int num) {
        if(num==0)return true;
        if(num%10==0){
            return false; //means leading xero
        }
        return true;
    }
};
