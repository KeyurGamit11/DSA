Input: nums = [0,0,1,1,1,1,2,3,3]
Output: 7, nums = [0,0,1,1,2,3,3,_,_]
Explanation: Your function should return k = 7, with the first seven elements of nums being 0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 3 and 3 respectively.
It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).
#step:
use two pointer in here
#code:
class Solution {
public:
    int removeDuplicates(vector<int>& nums) {
        int i=1;
        for(int j=1; j<nums.size(); j++){
            if(i == 1 || nums[j] != nums[i-2]){ // main condition
                nums[i] = nums[j];
                i++;
            }
        }
        return i;
    }
};
